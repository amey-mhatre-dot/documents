# Creating First Amazon EKS cluster and nodes

	Step 1: Create your Amazon EKS cluster and nodes
NOTES: The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case-sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and can't be longer than 100 characters.	
		1.1 Create your Amazon EKS cluster with the following command.
		$ eksctl create cluster --name ritesh-tomcat-cluster --region us-west-1 --nodes=2 --node-type=t2.micro --vpc-public-subnets subnet-0a51d369922e2cd65,subnet-09c867e32a53503d7

	Step 2: View Kubernetes resources
	
		2.1 View your cluster nodes.
		$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
		
		2.2 View the workloads running on your cluster
		$ kubectl get pods -A -o wide
		
	Step 3: Deploy sample application
    	
		3.1 Apply a deployment file
		$ kubectl create -f tomcat-deployment.yaml

		3.2 Verify that your pods are running and have their own internal IP addresses:
		$ kubectl get pods -o wide

NOTES: Keep in mind the following details:
* ClusterIP exposes the service on a cluster's internal IP address.
* NodePort exposes the service on each node’s IP address at a static port.
* LoadBalancer exposes the service externally using a load balancer.

	Step 4: Create a ClusterIP service

    		4.1 To expose a deployment of ClusterIP type, run the following imperative command:
		$ kubectl create -f clusterip.yaml
    
	    	4.2 Access the application and get the ClusterIP number
	    	$ kubectl get service tomcat-service-cluster-ip

	    	4.3 Delete the ClusterIP service:
	    	$ kubectl delete service tomcat-service-cluster-ip
	
	Step 5: Create a NodePort service
	
		5.1 To expose a deployment of NodePort type, run the following imperative command
    		$ kubectl create -f nodeport.yaml
    
		5.2 Get information about tomcat-service:
    		$ kubectl get service/tomcat-service-nodeport

NOTES: The ServiceType is a NodePort and ClusterIP that are created automatically for the service. 
The output from the preceding command shows that the NodePort service is exposed externally on the port (30994) of the available worker node's EC2 instance. 
Before you access NodeIP:NodePort from outside the cluster, you must set the security group of the nodes to allow incoming traffic. 
You can allow incoming traffic through the port (30994) that's listed in the output of the preceding kubectl get service command.

    		5.3 If the node is in a public subnet and is reachable from the internet, check the node’s public IP address:
		$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

		5.4 Delete the NodePort service:
		$ kubectl delete service tomcat-service-nodeport
 
	Step 6: Create a LoadBalancer service
	
		6.1 To expose a deployment of LoadBalancer type, run the following imperative command
		$ kubectl create -f loadbalancer.yaml
		
		6.2 Get information about tomcat-service and access the application on EXTERNAL-IP
		$ kubectl get service/tomcat-service-loadbalancer
		
		6.3 Delete the LoadBalancer service
		$ kubectl delete service tomcat-service-loadbalancer

	Step 7: Delete your deployments
		$ kubectl delete deployments tomcat-deployment
	
	Step 8: Delete your cluster and nodes
		$ eksctl delete cluster --name tomcat-cluster --region us-west-1
